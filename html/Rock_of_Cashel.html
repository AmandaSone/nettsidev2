			<h1>Rock of Cashel</h1>
			<p>The Rock of Cashel, also known as Cashel of the kings and St. Patrick’s Rock, is a historical site with medieval buildings. It’s located at Cashel, County Tippery. </p>
			<p>According to local legends, the Rock of Cashel was a result of St. Patrick banishing Satan from a cave! It’s said that by banishing Satan from Devil’s Bit Mountain, the Rock landed in Cashel. </p>
			<p>A bit more believable legend is that during the 5th century when the Rock of Cashel was inhabited by the King of Munster, St. Patrick himself came to convert him to Christianity. </p>
			<p>After that there were crownings of other kings, but who really cares about that? It’s hard to keep track anyway. Ireland was ruled by someone during most parts of its history! If you’re more interested in the other kings, you’re free to do your own research. </p>
			<p>The Rock of Cashel is a must visit in my opinion! The architecture is stunning, especially for lovers of medieval and gothic styles like me. But even if you aren’t, I’m positive you’d have an amazing time wandering around there.</p>
