			<h1>National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology</h1>
			<p>The National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology is located on Kildare Street in Dublin, and I think it’s a must if you're interested in Ireland’s ancient past. The museum is free to enter and has tons of interesting stuff, especially from prehistoric and early medieval times. One of the most interesting things I saw though was the collection of bog bodies. They’re real human remains from thousands of years ago, preserved in Irish bogs. They look pretty creepy, but they give a good sense of how people lived back then. And well, died too I guess you can say.</p>
			<p>Another thing I found really cool was the gold artifacts from the Bronze Age. There are huge gold collars, armlets, and other jewelry that show off the skills of ancient Irish craftsmen. It’s kind of crazy to think how advanced they were with no modern tools.</p>
			<p>If you like early Christian history, there’s a whole section with crosses, chalices, and even the famous Ardagh Chalice, which is nicely detailed.</p>
			<p>The museum isn’t massive, so you can see most of it in about 1–2 hours, perfect for people with shorter attention spans (cough, cough, me), and it's right in the city center. Nicely located for a short stop if you’re exploring Dublin on foot.</p>
